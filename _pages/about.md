Hey there, I am a passionate year 4 undergraduate student majoring in economics with a deep-seated interest in various fields. I consider myself a versatile individual with a diverse skill set and a passion for cutting-edge technology projects.

I am a deep AI user. During my most recent internship at Miracle Plus (former YC China), based in Beijing / Shanghai, China, where I held the role of Founders Relation and Product User Growth, I spearheaded deal sourcing, due diligence and drove enrollment growth for MiraclePlus Startup School. My venture capital endeavours ignited my enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and cutting-edge technologies. I've honed my focus on artificial intelligence (LLM, NLP, Agents, etc.), Crypto (Blockchain) and Metaverse, nurturing a strong desire to launch my own cause in these innovative domains.

My interests are diverse, spanning from Cycling, vintage aesthetics to techno rave, jazz, and captivating visuals. I've cultivated a personal Xiaohongshu account with 1000+ followers. Additionally, I am a **signed photographer** of Orient IC and Tuchong versed in post-production and video editing, and I am also a licensed sketch artist with a B-Level certificate.

As a certified Peer Listener, I am a compassionate communicator, skilled in Mandarin (First Language), and English (IELTS-7.0), beginner in French & Dutch.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I'm passionately into sports and travelling. I am a road bike **cyclist of NPCC** (No Power Cycling Club) and I am in UNNC **Touch Rugby Varsity** as a Wing player. Enthusiastic about gym, fitness, cycling, basketball, and I have travel experiences spanning **18 countries** worldwide as an adventurer seeking new experiences abroad.

I am open to discussions and welcome any advice or opportunities. **Feel free to reach me out.**
