Hey there, I am a passionate master student majoring in economics with a deep-seated interest in various fields. I consider myself a versatile individual with a diverse skill set and a passion for endurance sports and cutting-edge technology projects.

Some keywords of my past experiences that hopefully you might find useful: Triathlete, to B/G financing (VC and to G consulting), marketing, user growth, data analysis and global online retail (e-commerce).

I am an AI power user. During my most recent internship at Miracle Plus (former YC China), based in Beijing / Shanghai, China, where I held the role of Founders Relation and Product User Growth, I spearheaded deal sourcing, due diligence and drove user growth for MiraclePlus Startup School, where I designed and executed the whole viral growth by myself. My venture capital endeavours ignited my enthusiasm for entrepreneurship and cutting-edge technologies. I've honed my focus on artificial intelligence (LLM, NLP, Agents, etc.) and Metaverse, nurturing a strong desire to launch my own cause in these innovative domains.

My interests are diverse, spanning from triathlon (cycling, running, swimming), vintage aesthetics to techno rave, jazz, and captivating visuals. I've cultivated 2 personal Xiaohongshu accounts with 1000+ followers, one sharing my personal pics, and the other updating the newest AI product. Additionally, I am a **signed photographer** of Orient IC and Tuchong versed in post-production and video editing, and I am also a licensed sketch artist with a B-Level certificate.

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I'm passionately into sports and travelling. I am a **triathlete and signed bike racer for Beijing Huanyu Cycling Team** and I was in UNNC **Touch Rugby Varsity** as a Wing player. Enthusiastic about gym, fitness, and I have travel experiences spanning **18 countries** worldwide as an adventurer seeking new experiences abroad.

I am open to discussions and welcome any advice or opportunities. **Feel free to reach me out!**
